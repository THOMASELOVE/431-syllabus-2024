# Teaching Assistants {#sec-teachingassistants}

Almost all of this year's stellar group of teaching assistants have been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. They are volunteering their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course. All office hours and all teaching assistant work will be done remotely.

There is a lot to learn in this class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us! As mentioned earlier, **you shouldn't spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.**

### Alex Olejko {#sec-alex}

![Alex Olejko](images/Alex_Olejko.png){width=40%}

Alex is a 5th year PhD candidate in the Developmental, Cognitive, and Affective Sciences program in the Department of Psychological Sciences. He completed my undergraduate education at Ohio State, and earned my Master’s degree from CWRU in 2022. His research mainly resides in the field of behavior genetics, where he focuses on polygenic influences on behavioral outcomes. These outcomes mostly encompass educational and health phenotypes in the early to mid-twenties. Alex grew up outside of Cleveland and am a fervent Cleveland sports fan. He loves going to Guardians games and have already been to 20 this year (and counting). Some of his other favorite past-times include building Lego, mixology, exercise, and (mainly) single-player video games.

Miza Salim Hammoud is a postdoctoral research fellow at Cleveland Clinic’s Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery Department and is in her second year of the Masters of Science in Clinical Research (CRSP) program at CWRU. Her research goal is to construct predictive models that illuminate the path ahead for little lives touched by congenital heart defects, predicting both clinical outcomes and the quality of life perceived by patients and their families. Miza took 431 and 432 last year and is applying the amazing research skills gained from these two classes in her research projects. Beyond the realm of academia and research, Miza enjoys playing the piano’s melody, painting colors on canvas, and embarks on adventures that span the globe embracing the wonders of new countries and cultures.
